## Main Components

### 1. Dashboard

The Dashboard is the primary interface users interact with upon launching Noggin. It consists of two main sections: the Practice Feed and the Module Explorer sidebar.

    - "Start Quiz" button to launch the Quiz Mode for the most recently generated quiz
    - "Generate Quiz" button to open the Quiz Generation Modal
