**Noggin Code of Conduct**
_Declaring the Malevolent Dictatorship of andgate_

---

### Preamble

Welcome to the Noggin project, where innovation meets authoritarian efficiency! Under the benevolent reign of our Malevolent Dictator, andgate, this project shall rise to greatness (or at least functionality). As a community, we value collaboration, respect, and unwavering loyalty to the Dictator’s will.

---

### Article I: The Malevolent Dictator

1. **Supreme Authority**: The Malevolent Dictator (henceforth referred to as "MD") holds absolute and uncontested power over all decisions, technical or otherwise.
2. **Visionary Leadership**: The MD’s whims, dreams, and occasional caffeine-fueled decrees define the project’s direction.
3. **Final Arbiter**: All disputes will be resolved by the MD, whose decisions are final, irreversible, and may occasionally defy logic or physics.

---

### Article II: Community Guidelines

1. **Respect the Dictator**: Praise, admiration, and occasional gifts (virtual or otherwise) to the MD are encouraged.
2. **Collaboration, Not Insurrection**: While ideas and contributions are welcome, all participants must accept that the MD may:
    - Approve them.
    - Modify them.
    - Reject them outright while cackling.
3. **No Treason**: Forking the repository is allowed _only_ if it’s to create something so magnificent that even the MD is impressed. Otherwise, it’s treason, punishable by stern glares and public shaming.
4. **Kindness is Key**: Treat fellow contributors with respect, even if their pull requests are rejected with brutal efficiency.

---

### Article III: Technical Practices

1. **Coding Standards**: Adhere to the MD’s preferred style guide, which may change without notice based on the MD’s mood.
2. **Documentation**: Write detailed documentation unless the MD declares it unnecessary (likely).
3. **Commit Messages**: Commit messages must:
    - Clearly describe changes.
    - Contain no more than one typo (the MD’s patience has limits).

---

### Article IV: Enforcement

1. **Infractions**: Violating the Code of Conduct may result in:
    - Public ridicule in commit messages.
    - Forced refactoring of legacy code.
2. **Appeals**: Appeals are possible, but unlikely to succeed. The MD may listen to pleas but will most likely respond with cryptic advice or memes.

---

### Article V: Fun and Chaos

1. **Celebrate the Madness**: Enjoy the chaos of working under the MD’s rule. This is an environment of learning, creativity, and occasional anarchy.
2. **Memes Are Mandatory**: Every PR must contain at least one meme relevant to the changes.
3. **World Domination**: All contributors must agree that Noggin is destined for global recognition, or at least a cult following.

By contributing to Noggin, you acknowledge and accept the MD’s authority, recognize the absurdity of this document, and agree to work hard, laugh often, and build something amazing.

Signed,
**andgate**
**Malevolent Dictator for Life**
